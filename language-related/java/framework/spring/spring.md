## Inversion of Control
> Outsource to a Object Factory

> Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects to a container or framework.


### Advantages of Inversion of Control
- decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
- making it easier to switch between different implementations
- greater modularity of a program
- greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies

## Dependency Injection
